How we do it:

1. To start developing with the Landlab Community, start here: [Developer Installation Instructions](https://landlab.readthedocs.io/en/master/development/install/index.html#developer-install)

Follow instructions and you will have your own fork, just like University of Washington Landlab developers: e.g  github.com/ChristinaB/landlab   github.com/ - shelby -fix this/landlab      zhuoran    jeff

2.  The second that your fork is created, it may quickly be out of sync with the main trunk - [Keep Landlab Updated](https://landlab.readthedocs.io/en/master/development/install/updating.html)

$ git fetch upstream

[to do - address nuances of what to fetch when working on a team, origin? upstream? whose remote? 

3.  Create a new branch

4.  Add Collaborators

5.  Deveop on a Collaborator Branch, develop on your remote, keep your master updated to the Collaborator branch

6.  Add, commmit and do a pull request to add your contributions to a Landlab branch

`git pull-create-pull-request localBranch git@github.com:user/repo originBranch`

## Why do all of the above steps make life easier in the future? 

7.  Managing Pull Requests on github/landlab master branch
